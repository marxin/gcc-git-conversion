This repository contains the data files used in the GCC conversion
from Subversion to git.

The most important files are:

* gcc.lift - custom reposurgeon commands for this conversion.

* gcc.map - GCC contributor map.

Prerequisites:

1. You must have recent versions of the reposurgeon suite, git,
Subversion, and the cython JIT compiler installed.

2. Use cython to build cyreposurgeon (for speed) with "make cyreposurgeon".
in the reposurgeon source directory. Make sure it is in your $PATH.

3. Your machine will need to have a minimum of 45GB RAM.  

To run an entire conversion, simply type 'make'.  This will mirror
the Subversion repository and convert it to git, performing the
custom commands in gcc.lift at the appropriate time after first-stage
conversion.

Warning: this will take a long time, as the repository is huge.

Don't forget to run "make gc" to repack whem it's production ready.
